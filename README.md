# Challenge Eleven: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) - E-commerce Back End

## Project Description

Challenge Eleven required us to refactor the starting code, creating the backend for an ecommerce site with the Express.js API, Sequelize, and MySQL. THe user of this applciation can get, create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags. We've used Insomnia Core to test these routes which can be seen in the walkthrough video.

As shown in the video, CRUD operations are demonstrated for categories, products, and tags. 
1. All records are first retrieved.
2. A single record is retrieved based on ID in the URL.
3. A new record is created.
4. The new record is updated.
5. The new record is then deleted.
6. ALl records are then retrieved to show that the new record no longer exists.
